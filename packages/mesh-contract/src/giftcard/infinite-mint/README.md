# Infinite mint

Infinite mint is a vulnerability where there is no strict restriction on minting a particular policy where malicious players can mint more than desired tokens from one transaction. Normally it comes from when the validator checks against whether a particular token has been minted without strictly prohibiting other tokens from minting. This vulnerability is dangerous when a complex application relies on certain policy ID for authentication, while malicious players can produce uncontrolled circulation of token with that policy ID, leading to complex hacking scenarios causing loss of funds.
